**Microsoft 365 Security Hardening Lab**

This repository provides a structured, step-by-step lab for securing a Microsoft 365 tenant using real-world best practices. It is designed for security engineers, consultants, and learners who want practical experience with identity hardening, email security, endpoint protection, DLP, and monitoring configurations.

The lab environment mirrors how modern SMEs and enterprises configure security in production, with guidance on Conditional Access, Defender AV baselines, Safe Links/Safe Attachments, sensitivity labels, and alerting. Each section includes screenshots, examples, and recommended configuration settings.

The goal is to help users build a complete M365 security reference architecture that can be replicated, customised, or used as a baseline for client engagements. Community updates are encouraged to keep this content aligned with Microsoft’s evolving security ecosystem.
